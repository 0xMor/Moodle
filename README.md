🎓 Cophela Platform | Custom EdTech Ecosystem

Description Engineered a specialized e-learning ecosystem for an EU-funded pharmaceutical course in collaboration with the University of Granada. This project involved the architectural customization of Moodle to deliver an accessible and scalable learning experience.

I implemented a dual-stack solution using Drupal for robust content management and structural flexibility, seamlessly integrated with Moodle for LMS functionality. Additionally, I deployed advanced Google Analytics tracking to capture granular user interaction data, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize the educational path.

Key Technical Achievements:

System Integration: Successfully bridged Moodle LMS with Drupal CMS for enhanced administrative control.

Data Analytics: Implemented tracking pipelines to monitor user engagement and traffic patterns.

Scalability: Designed the platform to handle high-volume access for an international institutional program.
